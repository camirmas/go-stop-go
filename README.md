> Server implementation of the board game Go

### Introduction

This project implements an API server for the board game [Go](https://britgo.org/). It is written in Go (no pun intended), uses a PostgresQL database, and provides a GraphQL interface to comfortably support complex client applications. Here's a list of current client projects:
- https://github.com/tengen-io/web-client (React + Apollo web application)

Our goal is to build a fully open-source, free to play Go server. We are heavily inspired by the great work done by the [Lichess](https://github.com/ornicar/lila/) community, and similarly aim to build a healthy, thriving community around this incredible, three thousand year old game.

### Contributing
